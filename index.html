        As with all of our cats, Lucy is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated.
        All of our cats have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV and go home
        with a certificate for an examination by a King County veterinarian
        and their very own identification tag and collar. PLUS, most cat
        adoptions include 30 days of pet insurance from Trupanion - a great way
        to start off on the right paw!
